# EyeMotorCommand
This dataset contains motor command of a simulated eye model with 6 motors.

## Download

The datase is provided in a single **.mat file** with size 1.07 GB. The file is uploaded in Kaggle, please find it in this [link] () 


## Eye model

In figure a) a representation of the **right human eye** with its six extra-ocular muscles is shown. The muscles can rotate the eye in any three-dimensional orientation
around its fixed center of rotation. The right-handed head-fixed reference frame of Listing (arrowheads) shows the three cardinal axes: **horizontal (y), vertical (z) and torsional (x)**, respectively. Figure b) shows a cable-driven simulated righ human eye deviated from straigh ahead origin. To set the eye in different orientation cables are polling the eyeball to different direction according to the axis defined on the eye. **MR** and **LR** are Medial and Lateral Rectus, **SR** and **IR** Superior and Inferior Rectus, **SO** and **IO** Superior and Inferior Oblique.

## Main Features
- 2 × 106 ms of random motor responses on the 6 motots.
- Velocity of the motors.
- Orientation of the eye in 3D space.

Figure below shows a selected section of random motor responses over 3000 ms

## Data format

The .mat file contains several variables: 
* 6D eye position (state vector) in **horizontal (y), vertical (z) and torsional (x)** and their corresponding orientation.
* 6D motor command corresponding to **IR, MR, SR,LR, IO, SO** 

Other variables:
* Force of the motor commands
